Question 1: Simulating Temperature Behavior
a) Problem Statement
Consider a scenario where the temperature 𝑋(𝑡) varies randomly over a continuous time interval t, where t is in the range from 0 to 1. We begin with the assumption that 𝑋(0) = 0, which means that the temperature at time 0 is 0. Now, if we choose a small time increment represented by ∆𝑡, we can make the assumption that the change in temperature from time 𝑡 to 𝑡 + ∆𝑡, denoted as 𝑋(𝑡 + ∆𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡), follows a normal distribution. This normal distribution is characterized by a mean of 0 and a variance of ∆𝑡.

I. Let 𝑃 be the random variable denoting the proportion of time in [0, 1] such that the temperature is positive. Estimate the distribution of P by Monte Carlo simulation and experiment with various values of ∆𝑡 (e.g. ∆𝑡 = 0. 01, 0. 001, 0. 0001 ...)
II. Let 𝑇 be the random variable denoting the time in such that the temperature is at its 𝑚𝑎𝑥 [0, 1] maximum. Estimate the distribution of 𝑇 by Monte Carlo simulation and experimenting with 𝑚𝑎𝑥 various values of ∆𝑡 (e.g. ∆𝑡 = 0. 01, 0. 001, 0. 0001...)

Question 2: Premier League Forecasting Model
a) Problem Definition
Create a probabilistic model and perform Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the final points for Premier League teams in the 2024-2025 season. This model will include some unknown parameters that you will determine based on the data you gather.
